FocusMate: Design PCUP

Welcome to FocusMate: A digital distraction blocking software that helps you stay focused, manage your time effectively, and eliminate digital distractions in real-time.

This project was developed to address the growing challenges of digital distraction and focus management in today's hyperconnected world. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive tool that combines multiple techniques in one seamless interface to eliminate all the digital distractions and increase your focus in no time, while improving your overall mental wellbeing!!

FocusMate integrates four essential features:

1. Focus Timer - A customizable Pomodoro-style timer that helps you work in focused intervals followed by short breaks. The timer automatically tracks your focus time and updates your analytics.

2. Website Blocker - Block distracting websites during your focus sessions. Add any website to your blacklist to prevent access during scheduled focus times.

3. Task Management - Create, track, and complete tasks within the same interface as your timer. Mark tasks as complete with a single click and clear your list when finished.

4. Focus Analytics - Monitor your focus habits with visual charts showing your daily progress throughout the week. Track your total focused time to see your improvement.
